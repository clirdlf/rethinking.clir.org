  As cochair of the DPLA Content and Scope workstream, I am honored to be one of many who are contributing time and effort toward building a community, a conversational framework, and ultimately a distributed network of digital content free to all.
  This summer has been busy for DPLA. In addition to transitioning from a planning activity to a free-standing nonprofit organization, there has been a lot of activity around building the digital instance
  of the DPLA.
</p>
<p>The Digital Library Federation program sponsored a think
  tank meeting on June 15, which gave DLF community members an opportunity to
  engage with the DPLA technical development team and provide feedback on the
  DPLA technical plan. At the meeting it was determined that the DLF could play a valuable role in providing structured opportunities for the DLF community to participate in the DPLA conversation and development. Watch for future opportunities later
  this fall.
</p>
<p>The DPLA Audience and Participation workstream met in July
  at the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore to discuss DPLA <a target="_self" href="http://dp.la/use-cases/#">use cases</a>.
  Winston Tabb, Sheridan Dean of University Libraries at Johns Hopkins, was one
  of many workshop attendees who contributed to a useful discussion about how the
  use cases highlight service and content needs for the DPLA, as well as
  opportunities for advocacy and policy discussion regarding fair use and
  copyright. Nate Hill (@natenatenate) adeptly facilitated the workshop; notes
  from the workshop are <a target="_self" href="http://dp.la/get-involved/events/july-27-2012-audience-participation-second-workshop/">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In July, NEH <a target="_self" href="http://dp.la/2012/07/26/national-endowment-for-the-humanities-announces-award-to-support-development-of-dpla/">awarded the DPLA $1 million</a> to support the
  “content-hub” pilot. This
  pilot project will test the distributed network model for recruiting,
  harvesting, and providing access to digital collections metadata. Six to seven
  “hubs” representing various organizational and service models, as well as
  geographic regions, will work through policy, workflow, and other challenges to
  help inform the blueprint for a national content network. This will allow us to
  explore the benefits of working at scale, as well as to identify incentives for
  participation.

<p>Emily Gore (@ncschistory), a Frye Institute alumna who is
  currently the AUL for technology at Florida State University, has been named
  the Director of Content for DPLA and will <a target="_self" href="http://dp.la/2012/08/02/dpla-announces-new-director-for-content/">begin her term</a> on September 1. <a re_target="blank" target="blank"

  On August 6, the <a target="_self" href="http://dp.la/get-involved/events/august-5-6-2012-content-and-scope-workshop/">Content and Scope workstream</a> hosted a
  meeting in San Diego. <a re_target="blank" target="blank" href="http://dp.la/get-involved/events/august-5-6-2012-content-and-scope-workshop/"></a>The
  meeting’s goal was to work through data provider agreements and expectations of services for DPLA content hubs, as well as to discuss what can DPLA do
  differently to avoid being, in the words of Dan Chudnov (@dchud) of George
  Washington University, “yet another aggregation.”
</p>
<p>
  Past attempts to build large-scale digital collections
  have often been hindered by policy, process, and technology. How can we do
  things differently, in a way that ultimately moves the cart forward on this
  issue, and can yield big wins not just for the digital library community, but
  also for the communities we serve? This was the lead-off discussion for the
  August 6 Content and Scope workshop.
</p>
<p>Among the ideas discussed:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    How do we facilitate building “emergent
    collections”—i.e., those created by combining information about many
    collections—and explore larger themes that cross collections?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can we be agnostic about metadata schema in order
    to get the richest metadata, so that we can provide richer services? Is it
    possible to “break” the metadata record and atomize the record’s elements and
    store only the “relationships” represented in the record?
  </li>
  <li>
    CCO for metadata is the only way we can provide
    remix, reuse, and/or semantic services, like a data store of linked open data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Location, date, subject/themes, and/or event
    information can be used to help users navigate through a large pool of data, to
    provide context to individual items, and to build other collection based
    services.
  </li>
  <li>
    Collections can be used to engage local communities
    in conversations about themselves and local history, and to facilitate teaching
    and learning.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is our special collections—our unique materials—that
    will provide the greatest impact in a national digital library.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>What are your ideas?</p>
<p>Notes and other documents resulting from this meeting will
  be posted soon on the <a target="_self" href="http://dp.la/workstreams/content/">Content and Scope Workstream page</a><a re_target="blank" target="blank" href="http://dp.la/workstreams/content/"></a>. And,
  as always, comments and contributions are welcome at any time. This is an open
  community effort, driven by those who make the time to contribute.  The DPLA is crafted not to be a top-down
  organization, but as an emergent community effort. The success of the DPLA
  depends on us.
