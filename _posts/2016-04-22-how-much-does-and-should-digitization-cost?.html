You take the cost per item, multiply it by the number of items, and you’re done: problem solved. What’s that? You ask what the cost per item is? Well, it depends. . . what type of collection is it? Where is the collection based? Who’s doing the labor? Are there any preservation activities that need to be incorporated into the digitization workflow? How about metadata? How thorough do you </span><span style="color: windowtext;">want the records? What quality of images do you need? Where are you storing the digital files? What’s your sustainability plan? How about discoverability? Do you have digitization equipment at your institution or do you plan to work with a vendor or partner?</span></span></p>
<p class="normal"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">It doesn’t take long to realize that when it comes to digitization, the question of cost is more complicated than it initially appears. The high number of variables at play makes it challenging to estimate costs for an individual project, let alone compare costs between projects or develop broadly applicable guidelines.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Last week, CLIR’s</span><a href="http://www.clir.org/hiddencollections"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></a><a href="http://www.clir.org/hiddencollections"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> program organized a </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"><a href="http://dplafest2016.sched.org/event/5zZW/how-much-does-and-should-digitization-cost?iframe=no&amp;w=&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no">panel </a>to explore </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">issues of cost at DPLAfest 2016 in Washington, DC. The 45-minute session was intended to start a conversation about tools and resources that could help project planners arrive at informed budgets, and to offer insights to those assessing digitization proposals. DPLAfest, the annual conference organized by the</span><a href="http://dp.la/"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></a><a href="http://dp.la/"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Digital Public Library of America</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> (DPLA), was a particularly fruitful environment to discuss this topic. As a mass aggregation service for digitized sources, DPLA and its constituents are naturally invested in efficient digitization. DPLA’s</span><a href="http://dp.la/info/hubs/become-a-hub/"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></a><a href="http://dp.la/info/hubs/become-a-hub/"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">hub model</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> also provides an interesting regional approach to addressing cost questions at scale. It’s worth mentioning that DPLA and other open aggregation platforms helped inspire the adoption of a new core value for CLIR’s Hidden Collections program: <i>connectedness</i>, highlighting the need to maximize the discoverability and accessibility of digitized material along side related materials. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">The panel opened with a presentation by Joyce Chapman, assessment librarian at Duke University, on the </span><a href="http://statelibrarync.org/plstats/digitization_calculator.php"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Digitization Cost Calculator</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> (beta) created by the </span><a href="https://wiki.diglib.org/Assessment"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">DLF Assessment Interest Group</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">.<span>  </span>The Cost Calculator is a planning tool that aims to provide time and cost estimates for digitization projects. Chapman and her colleagues began their project by assembling a </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yFWNWonZXHEFagI0A4ujeCl6U7SriJbfmqAgFGLA-Os/edit"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">bibliography</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">, and were surprised to find fewer than 20 resources on the subject of digitization costs. They then created </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jTJmCzKsa83BMdlgKj239Shqcbglq7I4EfxJIWWDQo/edit"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">best practice guidelines</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> for collecting<span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> time data for various digitization processes; these were finalized in July 2015. Since then, the group has been soliciting data to inform the calculator and make its assessments more accurate. </span>They are cognizant of what it requires to collect this data and seek to offer support to contributors through their upcoming “</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qj6sNMhrdc3044IsPYhrG7nq0RQb-XzOz3oWcNwTI08/edit"><span style="color: windowtext; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Day of Data</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">” initiative, which challenges professionals to set aside a</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> single day (or work shift) for timing themselves during one or more of the processes in their digitization workflow.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">The next speaker, Sandra McIntyre, Director of the </span><a href="http://mwdl.org/"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Mountain West Digital Library</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> (MWDL), spoke about MWDL’s attempt to establish common pricing across digitization centers in their region. The MWDL is a DPLA service hub that has ingested one million items from 825 collections throughout the mountain west region. They established a Digital <span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Services Pricing Task Force, which conducted a survey of prices offered by several vendors and DPLA Service Hubs. While they experienced difficulty convincing vendors to share their information, they </span>had a good response from academic libraries and government groups, which enabled them to establish their</span><a href="http://mwdl.org/docs/MWDL_Digital_Services_Price_List_2015.pdf"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></a><a href="http://mwdl.org/docs/MWDL_Digital_Services_Price_List_2015.pdf"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Digital Services Price List</span></a><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">. Both MWDL digitization center managers and new digital collections partners have enjoyed the advantages in common pricing, such as simplified project planning and review.</span></p>
<p class="normal"><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Jen Palmentiero, <span style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Digital Services Librarian at </span></span><a href="http://www.senylrc.org/"><span style="color: windowtext; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">Southeastern New York Library Resources Council </span></a><span style="color: windowtext; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">(SENYLRC), gave the final presentation, offering a perspective from a regional consortium servicing smaller organizations. SENYLRC has a diverse member base including institutions focused on K-12 education, small museums, and organizations that do not see cultural memory as a primary function, such as hospitals. Jen described how institutions that otherwise might not be able to afford digitization, could pool resources through SENYLRC and gain access to subscriptions and related services that support digitization work. Their members have access to web hosting, backup services, collections management and digital curation software, DPLA and WorldCat harvesting, and hardware if needed. The consortium also provides organizations with training and personalized consultation. The presentation closed with a look at SENYLRC’s pricing models and three case studies of small-scale digitization projects, tailored to the institutions’ individual circumstances. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span style="color: windowtext; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">In 45 minutes we were barely able to scratch the surface of the question, <i>How much does digitization cost</i>? What digitization <i>should </i>cost, is a question inherently intertwined with complex conversations about labor and best practices, and deserves a much richer exploration than we ultimately had time for last week. However, our brief conversation introduced new resources and shed light on why cost modeling and cost comparisons can be so challenging. Beyond the many variables to consider, it is time consuming to conduct a survey of prices, particularly given the lack of transparency from many providers. There is also limited literature available on costs to guide these efforts, suggesting a need for further research. Cost planning is particularly difficult for organizations with limited capacity, which can benefit from a regional or other focused network that provides targeted guidance and services. </span></p>
<p class="normal"><span style="color: windowtext; background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">There is a clear need for further conversations about this topic and resources to make </span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri;">cost planning and assessment more accessible to projects and institutions of all types. So let’s keep talking about the cost of digitization. It’s a simple enough request. </span></p>
