  The Montana Historical Society (MHS) is pleased to announce the launch of the Montana History Wiki Subject Guide on the life and work of Senator Lee Metcalf, which is the culmination of 1½ years of work and research for the Lee Metcalf
Photograph and Film Collections CLIR Hidden Collections grant project by project archivist Matthew M. Peek. Peek used the information gained from interviews with former Metcalf employees and friends, Metcalf's papers, information from the photographs
and films themselves, and newspaper articles, to assist in the identification and description of the senator's photographs and is using the information to assist in identifying Metcalf's film reels. </p>

  The subject guide includes Matthew Peek's unpublished, lengthy, cited papers on Metcalf’s role in Civil Rights; the conservation movement and the development of the Wilderness Act; the Economic Opportunity Act; Metcalf and the Montana
congressional of the 1950s-1960s use of media to reach out to their Montana constituents; and the genealogy of Senator Metcalf and his wife Donna Metcalf’s families. Interesting information includes background histories on Metcalf’s two parents’
families, who were early Montana settlers in Ravalli County and Butte, and about whom nothing has been researched, written, or preserved in the state or in Ravalli County. The Metcalf Subject Guide also has links to all of the blog posts, newspaper
articles, public talks, and television interviews done about Metcalf by Peek as part of the Hidden Collections grant project. This guide is the first cited research on Senator Metcalf, published in great detail, ever written, which extensively uses
his materials from the Lee Metcalf Papers (MC 172) housed in the MHS Archives. The guide, part of the Montana Historical Society's state history wiki, which provides the public with multiple historical subject guides, research aids, indexes, and
other materials for public researchers, is free to use by the public and school teachers.
