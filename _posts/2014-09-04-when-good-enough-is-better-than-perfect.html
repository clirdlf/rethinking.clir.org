                        <p class="">When I was a PhD student I had a terrible habit of wanting something to be perfect before I’d let anyone see it.<span> In hindsight, </span>I started to refer to this as being stuck in a “perfection trap.”<span> </span>That’s one of many reasons it took me six years to do a four-year degree.<span> </span>Finally, my supervisor took me aside and said <i>“It doesn’t have to be perfect, it has to be done.”</i></p>
<p class="">I used that as a mantra for the rest of my thesis writing and it really helped me focus.<span> </span>I was able to set myself deadlines and get things to my supervisor even if they weren’t “perfect.”<span> </span>I even defended knowing that there were problems with my thesis.<span> </span>And I passed—because even though it wasn’t perfect, it was good enough for a PhD.<span> </span>I’m still fighting the perfection trap in my academic work.<span> </span>I hold off on sending things in working drafts, even if I have a co-author.<span> </span>If I do send something that’s not “perfect,” I’ll apologize and include a statement such as “feel free to ignore this until it’s better.”<span></span><span> <br>
</span></p>
<p class="">I know this habit has hurt me professionally in my academic work.<span> </span>It has made me miss conferences I wanted to attend but didn’t because my work wasn’t “perfect.”<span> </span>It has also kept me from submitting papers to journals because I wanted to do another round or rewriting to make it “perfect.”<span> P</span>rocrastination often goes along with perfectionism.<span> </span>I’d put off working on a paper because I knew that I could never make it perfect.<span> </span>My house was always really clean when I was first struggling with my thesis.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="">What is strange is that I don’t do this in my consulting work.<span> </span>When I’m consulting I never get stuck in the perfection trap.<span> </span>I’m happy to send rough drafts to people to get their feedback before finishing a report, to present ideas that are not fully formed, and even to stop working on a project because it is done, not because it is perfect.<span> </span><span></span>And I have never needed an extension on a deadline.<span>   </span></p>
<p class="">When I moved back into the library with my CLIR fellowship I knew I had one year to do a lot of work.<span> </span>I quickly found myself slipping into the perfectionist habits from my PhD years.<span> </span>I realized that in a library these habits could hurt both me and the library, since many of my research projects were attached to larger library-wide projects.<span> </span>If I didn’t get my work done, the quality of services provided to HBS faculty and staff could be affected.<span> </span>Understanding this helped me see that I needed to avoid the perfection trap during my fellowship. <span></span>I decided to treat most of my work as though I were consulting. <span></span>I used these “rules” from my consulting work to make sure I didn’t get trapped again: </p>
<p><i><strong>1. Do what’s necessary, not what’s nice</strong></i>
</p>
<p>This is something I asked myself at the beginning of, and throughout, a project.<span> </span>Was what<span> </span>I was working on “nice to have” or “necessary”?<span> </span>I kept a list of parts of a project and sorted them into these two groups.<span> </span>If I had time, I’d tackle the “nice to have” list, but if I were pressed for time or had something else to move on to, I’d stick to the “necessary.”<span>   </span></p>

<p><strong>2. Set real deadlines (and immediate consequences)</strong>
</p>
<p>Obviously there are deadlines in academia but often, as you get higher up, these deadlines are self-imposed, and if there are consequences they are far in the future.<span> </span><span></span>With consulting, not making a deadline would at least involve having to explain yourself to your client or boss, or both.<span> </span>To create real consequences I started to schedule presentations, big and small, of my research.<span> </span>I never wanted to have to explain to the group that I didn’t have something new to present so I would present things before they were perfect.<span class="st"><i> <br>
</i></span></p>

<p><strong>3. Set short deadlines and stick to them</strong><br>
Related to rule 2, I worked really hard to have short deadlines and stick to them.<span> </span>I would break projects up into small parts so they didn’t loom large in my life.<span> </span>Then I’d set short, but realistic, deadlines.<span> </span>Once the deadline hit I had to move on and could not revisit that part until everything else was done.<span> </span>It led to some frantic writing close to the deadline but it meant that a project, while not perfect, was finished. Then I could improve it if there was time.<span>   </span> </p>
<p class=""><span class="st">One of my friends who consults always repeats this quote from Lorne Michaels, the founder of Saturday Night Live, to new hires:<span>  </span>“The show doesn't go on because it's</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal;"></span><span class="st"> ready<i>; </i>it goes on because it's </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-style: normal;"></span><span class="st">11:30.” Using this quote and my three rules, I got a lot more done during my year at HBS than I ever thought I could.<span>  </span>I’d love to hear from other people about approaches they use at work to avoid falling into the "perfection trap.” </span></p>
