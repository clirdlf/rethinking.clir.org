title: When Good Enough is Better than Perfect

<p>When I was a PhD student I had a terrible habit of wanting something to be perfect before I'd let anyone see it. In hindsight, I started to refer to this as being stuck in a “perfection trap.” That's one of many
  reasons it took me six years to do a four-year degree. Finally, my supervisor took me aside and said <i>“It doesn't have to be perfect, it has to be done.”</i></p>
<p>I used that as a mantra for the rest of my thesis writing and it really helped me focus. I was able to set myself deadlines and get things to my supervisor even if they weren't “perfect.” I even defended knowing
  that there were problems with my thesis. And I passed—because even though it wasn't perfect, it was good enough for a PhD. I'm still fighting the perfection trap in my academic work. I hold off on sending
  things in working drafts, even if I have a co-author. If I do send something that's not “perfect,” I'll apologize and include a statement such as “feel free to ignore this until it's better.”
</p>
<p>I know this habit has hurt me professionally in my academic work. It has made me miss conferences I wanted to attend but didn't because my work wasn't “perfect.” It has also kept me from submitting papers to
  journals because I wanted to do another round or rewriting to make it “perfect.” Procrastination often goes along with perfectionism. I'd put off working on a paper because I knew that I could never make it perfect.
  My house was always really clean when I was first struggling with my thesis.  </p>
<p>What is strange is that I don't do this in my consulting work. When I'm consulting I never get stuck in the perfection trap. I'm happy to send rough drafts to people to get their feedback before finishing a
  report, to present ideas that are not fully formed, and even to stop working on a project because it is done, not because it is perfect. And I have never needed an extension on a deadline.   </p>
<p>When I moved back into the library with my CLIR fellowship I knew I had one year to do a lot of work. I quickly found myself slipping into the perfectionist habits from my PhD years. I realized that in a library
  these habits could hurt both me and the library, since many of my research projects were attached to larger library-wide projects. If I didn't get my work done, the quality of services provided to HBS faculty and staff could be
  affected. Understanding this helped me see that I needed to avoid the perfection trap during my fellowship. I decided to treat most of my work as though I were consulting. I used these “rules” from my
  consulting work to make sure I didn't get trapped again: </p>
<p><i><strong>1. Do what's necessary, not what's nice</strong></i></p>
<p>This is something I asked myself at the beginning of, and throughout, a project. Was what I was working on “nice to have” or “necessary”? I kept a list of parts of a project and sorted them into these two
  groups. If I had time, I'd tackle the “nice to have” list, but if I were pressed for time or had something else to move on to, I'd stick to the “necessary.”   </p>

<p><strong>2. Set real deadlines (and immediate consequences)</strong>
</p>
<p>Obviously there are deadlines in academia but often, as you get higher up, these deadlines are self-imposed, and if there are consequences they are far in the future. With consulting, not making a deadline would at least
  involve having to explain yourself to your client or boss, or both. To create real consequences I started to schedule presentations, big and small, of my research. I never wanted to have to explain to the group that I
  didn't have something new to present so I would present things before they were perfect.<i> 
  </i></p>

<p><strong>3. Set short deadlines and stick to them</strong></p>
<p>
  Related to rule 2, I worked really hard to have short deadlines and stick to them. I would break projects up into small parts so they didn't loom large in my life. Then I'd set short, but realistic, deadlines.
  Once the deadline hit I had to move on and could not revisit that part until everything else was done. It led to some frantic writing close to the deadline but it meant that a project, while not perfect, was finished. Then I
  could improve it if there was time.   </p>
<p>One of my friends who consults always repeats this quote from Lorne Michaels, the founder of Saturday Night Live, to new hires:  “The show doesn't go on because it's ready<i>; </i>it goes on because it's 11:30.” Using this quote and
  my three rules, I got a lot more done during my year at HBS than I ever thought I could.  I'd love to hear from other people about approaches they use at work to avoid falling into the "perfection trap.” </p>
