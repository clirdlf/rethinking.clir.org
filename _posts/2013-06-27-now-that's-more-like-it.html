                        <p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Last week I participated in the second </span><font size="1"><a href="http://summit2013.lodlam.net/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Linked Open Data for Libraries Archives and Museums Summit</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> (LODLAM), held at the </span><a href="http://www.banq.qc.ca/accueil/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Québec</span></a></font><span style="color: rgb(57, 65, 68); font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial;">.</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">Information about the summit and the LODLAM community can be found with the #LODLAM tag. It’s a big conversation that spans the world, and it is only getting more interesting and exciting.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jon Voss, Historypin strategic partnerships director at </span><a href="http://wearewhatwedo.org/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We are What we Do</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;">, spearheaded the first summit meeting two years ago and coordinated the second. He is largely responsible for keeping the faith and encouraging the momentum, openness, and fluid borders that surround this community. He makes community building look easy and effortless.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">The second summit came to fruition as a result of interest from Leon Robichaud (University of Sherbrooke-Canada) and Jean-Francois Gauvin (Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec), who contacted Jon and asked if they could help organize a follow-on meeting with some startup funding. Jason Kusma offered support from <a href="http://metro.org/">Metro</a></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. The Digital Library Federation, OCLC, ADLIb, and Europeana rounded out the patronage with additional support from Internet Archive, DPLA, DigitalNZ, Medeley, and Semantic Web. It was great to plan a meeting with such an international group of passionate folks.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">So what made this meeting so special? Why is it important? There are many reasons.</span></p>
<p class=""><b style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is based on passion and action—</span></b><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Jon puts it best: </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: rgb(65, 75, 82); background-color: rgb(250, 249, 249); font-family: Arial;">“</span><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">The meeting is based on the two primary principles of passion and responsibility: passion to jump in and play an active role; and responsibility to lead, and follow through with action. No papers will be submitted or read, no plenaries given, and everyone will participate.”</span></p>
<p class=""><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is international—</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">This was one of the most global meetings I have been to in North America. Check out the <a href="http://summit2013.lodlam.net/about/participants/">participants list</a> for yourself.</span></p>
<p class=""><b style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It uses an unconference format—</span></b><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Using Open Space technology to organize the summit, participants come knowing they are responsible for making it a great meeting. They provide the ideas, the conversation, and the action. This is not your mother’s passive “sage on the stage” conference. The Law of Mobility was also in full effect; if you didn’t like the conversation, you moved to another room.</span></p>
<p class=""><b style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was fun—</span></b><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Yes it was serious, but in the </span><a href="http://summit2013.lodlam.net/challenge/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Challenge</span></a><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;"> and the Dork Shorts (two-minute briefs in which participants talk about their work), and even in the sessions, it was demonstrated that passion, tempered with humor, was an inspired combination. Creativity is an essential ingredient for innovation. A creative approach is what’s required for GLAMs (Galleries, Archives and Museums) today.</span></p>
<p class=""><b style="font-size: 12px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There were prizes—</span></b><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;">Yes, I am biased, as this is what I helped most with, but the Challenge was my favorite part of the summit. The Challenge was a call to the community to present ideas, mash-ups, models, and tools that used—or showed the promise of—Linked Open Data. We asked for submissions from teams, demonstrating their ideas using a short video clip. More than 19 entries were submitted via 2 heats. (Entries for </span><a href="http://summit2013.lodlam.net/challenge/challenge-entries/challenge-entries-heat-1/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Heat 1</span></a><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;"> and </span><a href="http://summit2013.lodlam.net/challenge/challenge-entries/challenge-entries-heat-2/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Heat 2</span></a><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial;"> can be viewed here.)</span></p>
<p class=""><a href="http://summit2013.lodlam.net/2013/06/19/lodlam-challenge-finalists-for-your-consideration/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Five finalists</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> were chosen. These finalists received some travel support and competed head to head at the summit, giving five-minute pitches to a distinguished panel of judges. In the end, the </span><a href="http://summit2013.lodlam.net/2013/04/03/pundit/"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Team from Pundit</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> won bragging rights as the first LODLAM challenge winner, and walked away with a little spending money.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">All said and done, the biggest winner is the community, getting 19 use cases, creatively pitched with video that is open for anyone to view. It was a big win all around.</span></p>
<p class=""><b><span style="font-family: Arial;">It’s open—</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yes, we are talking about linked data (isn’t everyone?), but key to this meeting and its community is the concept of <i>open</i>. It is becoming the flag we wave and a badge of honor; it is the tattoo on our hearts. <i>Open</i> is what GLAMS stand for in a civil society. Yet, <i>open</i> is at great risk today as our world becomes more digital. <b></b></span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">Open data, whether it is our collections metadata or the objects themselves, is fundamental to how a linked data world works and scales. But </span><i style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;">open</i><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 12px;"> applies not only to the topic at hand; it also applies to the community that is rallying around the flag.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">LODLAM was created to be an inclusive community. Anyone can use the tag, and anyone can host a LODLAM event. It allows for efficient self-organization around a topic and a “can-do” ethos. Three years in, and after a second successful summit, I believe we have a robust, committed, and passionate community that crosses continents and oceans. We couldn’t have done it if we had tried to assert ownership of the idea, or if we had tried to lock down the LODLAM identity or brand. The fact that we even had a second summit, based on interest from individuals who did not attend the first, speaks to the success of this self-organizing principle.</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">These principles of a common cause, shared passion, inspired action, and an open community will be critical as LODLAM moves forward. Should there be another summit? Who should attend? Where should it be? Will it be in 2014 or 2015? International or regional?  Let us know what you think in the comment space below, on </span><a href="http://lodlam.net"><span style="font-family: Arial;">LODLAM.net</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;">, or on this open </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HUutWxYrhRtYMt7NjQ46WEmCXNo-zWHLg0MJlr_Pu8E/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1HUutWxYrhRtYMt7NjQ46WEmCXNo-zWHLg0MJlr_Pu8E/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Google Doc</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"> .</span></p>
<p class=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">It really is up to you how and where this goes. Hope to see you there.</span></p>
