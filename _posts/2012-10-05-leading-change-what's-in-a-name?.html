<p>
  The question is often asked, “What is in a name, anyway?”
  The answer, when it comes to the newly titled EDUCAUSE/CLIR Leading Change Institute,
  is “Everything.”</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.leadingchangeinstitute.org/">Leading Change Institute</a>, formerly known as The Frye
  Institute, has a tremendous history including a number of highly connected
  cohorts from the various classes. When the Frye Leadership Institute welcomed
  its first class of students in 2000, the prevailing views of higher education
  leadership, information services, and the relationship of information services
  to the college community were in flux. According to a review of the Top Ten
  Trends by EDUCAUSE, in 2000 the focus was on funding IT, faculty development
  and support, distance education, e-learning environments, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Emerging technologies, advanced networking, e-commerce,
  and e-learning environments were the issues to watch.</p>
<p>
  In 2000, conversations were shifting from a single
  department or campus focus to a collaborative theme. Regional connectivity and
  networks were works in progress, and digitizing materials and archives had become a
  burgeoning business. “E” conversations were dominant and information services
  professionals were looked to as resources to navigate the path from print to
  digital repositories. Classroom technologies were becoming more complex and
  faculty and other academic professionals were seeking guidance, training, and
  assistance in leveraging the growing number of electronic tools in order to
  change the student experience.</p>
<p>
  Today, the top ten issues as identified in the 2012 EDUCAUSE
  survey include: updating IT skills and roles, IT consumerization, cloud
  strategies, using IT to improve efficiencies, integrating IT into institutional
  decision making, analytics, funding IT strategically, and using IT
  transformatively. Wow!  The conversation
  has definitely changed since 2000 and the skill sets of the leaders needed to
  move forward are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>
  The need for creative, innovative leaders increases each day,
  but such leaders are in short supply. Surveys by higher education and library
  organizations such as EDUCAUSE, ARL, and ACE point to a diminishing number of
  aspirants seeking careers in information services and a decline in the number desiring
  to hold the most senior position in these areas.  </p>
<p>
  In response to this dynamic, fast-paced environment and in
  conjunction with the feedback from the 2011 institute, the Leading Change
  Institute will emphasize participant projects and real world experiences that
  develop higher-level skill sets. A basis of these skill sets is understanding the
  “bigger” picture of higher education, major issues of the day, perspectives of
  current institutional leadership, viewpoints of national association leadership,
  and the interactions of these in developing effective solutions to the
  challenges of higher education. </p>
<p>
  The ability to lead change requires flexibility, an understanding
  of the current issues, the ability to think critically and to analyze issues
  and potential solutions, a willingness to collaborate, and the ability to think
  creatively about the best interests of institutions and higher education.
  Cultivating these qualities requires an environment where viewpoints are shared,
  positions are advocated for, and individuals are mentored and a gain a network
  from which they benefit throughout their careers. It is an environment where issues
  are discussed, investigated, critiqued, collaborated on, and solved in the
  greater context of the challenges of the next generation.
</p>
<p>
  All leaders are and will be required to be change agents and
  change managers. The application of lessons learned from colleagues, deans,
  national leaders and next generation learners will inform and affect the higher
  education community in ways we can only imagine. Preparation for these
  positions and challenges is critical and the Leading Change Institute is an
  important part of the path to the future.
