                        <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">When a friend passes away, it always leaves me thinking: What did I learn from our friendship, and what should I do to honor that friend—not just on that day or as a one-time gesture, but over time? How can I change the way I live my life, positively inspired by that friendship?</span>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;"> <br>
The recent passing of Lee Dirks and his wife Judy Lew in a tragic <a href="http://leeandjudy.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/judy-lew-and-lee-dirks-long-time-seattle-residents-and-microsoft-veterans-involved-in-a-fatal-auto-accident-in-peru/%20">car accident</a> in Peru </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">has me thinking about these questions again. There are many great stories about Lee and Judy—just check out <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ldirks">Lee’s facebook page</a> to see how wide an impact their lives had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">Yet, because of Lee’s broad influence among his colleagues in academic research, libraries, data curation, and technology, my question is broader: <i>How do we as a community honor the lesson of Lee Dirk’s support and friendship? </i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">There have been a number of remembrances posted by our community members, but the one that struck me most was Peter Brantley’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141111000040/http://blogs.publishersweekly.com:80/blogs/PWxyz/2012/09/05/remembering-lee-dirks/">blog post</a> in Publisher’s Weekly </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">In particular, it was this passage that hit home:</span></p>
<p><font size="2">He wanted what we all of us wanted: ready access to more information online, and tools to use it. His encouragement seemed all the more striking because of where he worked; his willingness to leverage the Microsoft’s resources on behalf of libraries, archives, and academic publishing around the world struck us as exceptional, something we never took for granted. His enthusiasm and support made us wonder why every major technology company didn’t have someone like Lee. Except that there was no one else like Lee. He was an amazing ambassador for Microsoft, and he was more than that: <i>he filled us with passion for our own ideas</i> [emphasis added].</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br>
</span></font><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana; background: white;">Again: “he filled us with the passion of our own ideas.” He always encouraged us to dream big—work together—and <i>make something happen</i></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana; background: white;">. He believed that libraries and librarians had something important to contribute, especially to the worlds of research and scholarly communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana; background: white;">All too often, we librarians second guess ourselves or our colleagues and sell ourselves short. We act too slowly, think too small, are often quick to dismiss ideas, and tend to lower the bar for our aspirations.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;"> It is time to change all of that. We need to expect more—of ourselves, of our colleagues, and of our capacity to change. We have a lot to learn from Lee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">A few weeks ago I participated in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130308021308/http://www.tilburguniversity.edu:80/research/institutes-and-research-groups/ticer/2012/">Ticer Summer School for Digital Libraries</a></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">. It was a great experience and one I recommend to any who have a chance to attend. The best part was finally meeting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122232404/http://quartz.syr.edu/blog/?page_id=27">David Lankes</a></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160122232404/http://quartz.syr.edu/blog/?page_id=27"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></a></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">, author of </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><i><a href="http://www.newlibrarianship.org/"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Atlas of New Librarianship</span></a></i></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;"> and director of Syracuse University’s Library and Information Science Program. I had talked to him by conference call lifetimes ago when I worked at the <a href="http://www.imls.gov">Institute of Museum and Library Services</a> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">as he was working on the <i>Atlas</i></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">. But it was at Ticer that I had the chance to talk with him about his passion for libraries and librarianship and his thoughts about what our biggest challenges are. We discussed his presentation—<i><a href="http://quartz.syr.edu/rdlankes/Presentations/2012/Ticer-PDF.pdf">New Librarianship and Libraries as Platform</a></i></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><a href="http://quartz.syr.edu/rdlankes/Presentations/2012/Ticer-PDF.pdf"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"></span></a></span><span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">,</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;"> especially the <font size="3"><a href="http://www.newlibrarianship.org/wordpress/?page_id=1811">mission statement for librarians</a></font>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span>      <font size="2">   </font></span><font size="2">“The mission of librarians is to improve society through facilitating knowledge creation in their communities” </font></span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">There is a lot to unpack here—the online <i>Atlas</i> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">really helps navigate and understand the complexity of such a simple statement. For me, it brought into sharp focus that we, as librarians, often constrain ourselves. We tend to think of our libraries only in terms of collections, and not how we, in active conversation with our communities, help build new knowledge and are capable of enacting social change. Since the rise of mass printing, we have come to think of libraries primarily as book warehouses with a collection-centric operational focus. We are more than our books. Or we should be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana;">For me, the person who exemplified “new librarianship in action” was Lee Dirks. He embraced change and created community everywhere he went. <span style="background: white;">We need to remember and see what Lee saw in us, and, like Lee, be ready and willing to contribute to something bigger than ourselves. We have to stop selling ourselves short. We should be excited about trying something new and be ready to listen with an open mind to a new idea. It is time to step outside our comfort zone and our institutional confines to work on the big issues, together. We should strive toward “new librarianship” with gusto, being less passive and more active. We should stretch, risk more, be unafraid of being wrong or less than perfect, accept that we are in an iterative development cycle, and be comfortable with failure and mistakes. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana; background: white;">Because if we are not failing, we are not learning; if we are not learning, we are not growing. If we are not growing, how can we be relevant? It is this approach to librarianship and the enthusiastic rise to the challenge that will always remind me of Lee. It would be befitting to his memory if we actually made good on the promise of the potential he saw in us. </span></p>
