editors of <i>Archive Journal</i>’s new issue, entitled “<a href="http://www.archivejournal.net/issue/4/archives-remixed/" title="Publishing the Archive"><span style="color:blue">Publishing the Archive</span></a>,”
has proven sobering and instructive, to say the least. Every piece in the issue
calls attention to the daunting (and possibly insurmountable) challenges in the
digital age of preserving archival materials in an ephemeral medium.
Particularly enlightening in this regard is Jefferson Bailey’s “<a href="http://www.archivejournal.net/issue/4/archives-remixed/tagokor-biography-of-an-electronic-record/" title="TAGOKOR: Biography of an Electronic Record"><span style="color:blue">TAGOKOR:
Biography of an Electronic Record</span></a>,” which traces the protean life of
a Korean War casualty file through sixty-plus years of digital evolution, from
its origin as a set of 109,975 punch cards through a dizzying array of
iterations and platforms to its present-day (and by no means final),
web-mediated life a remove or two from the grid. The story of the archive’s
life (or, more accurately, series of lives) is a cautionary tale to anyone
harboring illusions about reliably preserving information in the face of
technological progress. Or, as Bailey puts it, “Servile to the pull of technological
change, the whims of human signification, and the longevity of printed errata,
early electronic data files and digital archival records like TAGOKOR exist at
a distinct intersection of documentation, mechanism, and technological
reconstitution that discommode ideas of trustworthiness, decipherability, and
explication.”<br>

</font>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">From 1950 into 1964, the TAGOKOR
data was preserved on punch cards, and the legacy of that medium’s organization
of information, lurking in the present-day record like cosmic background
radiation, reminds us all of the power of mistaken assumptions about the
future. “Curiously, prior to conversion the cards were sequenced by state, then
by county within state, then alphabetically by individual name within county.
This model was ‘dictated by past experience indicating that future research
activity’ would be based on requests by state and county. This first moment of
preservation reformatting thus offers an early glimpse of how administrative
decision-making, along with expectations of research use, shape the arrangement
of, and access to, the historical record.”<br>

</font>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In November 1964, the record was
converted to seven-track magnetic tape, and two copies were made. Subsequently,
it was copied onto a nine-track tape, “EBCDIC file that is standard DOS
labeled.” No one could read the tapes, however, as there was no program
available to process the data, whose public-use version was a “well-worn
printout of the record fields along with the attendant key file.” In 1989, the
data was copied again, this time onto “an archival master 18-track, 27871 bpi,
3480 magnetic tape cartridge.” (I’m skipping over a lot of fun stuff here, like
the EBCDIC-to-ASCII coding at one point causing every date-of-death entry to be
rendered as an ampersand.)<br>
<br>
</span></font></p>
<font size="3" face="Arial">
</font>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">With the emergence in the 1990s of
the World Wide Web as an information resource, TAGOKOR made its tortuous way
there as well, undergoing significant transmogrification. “TAGOKOR’s early
appearance on the web reflects the characteristics of that medium—its quirks of
design, methods of arrangement and access, and also its ephemerality. These
websites provide their own parallel narrative of the retransmission and
recontextualization of the TAGOKOR file.” Most interesting was a
TAGOKOR-displaying web site entitled “The Ramblings of Whitey Reese,” the brief
life of which began in 2000. “Viewing the many captures of the website over
time, a contemporary user cannot help but feel a nostalgic charm, no doubt
evoked by the animated gifs, the blinking ‘click here’ buttons, and the lengthy
list of html tables—all reminders of early web design, syntax, and
construction. That TAGOKOR’s reuse can be so historically situated, dependent
upon the customs and visual aesthetics of early networked technologies, is a
reminder of the file’s ongoing, alternate existence outside the custody of the
National Archive.”<br>

only a glimpse here at a fraction of the enchanting details in Bailey’s
narrative—brings to mind Jerome McGann’s rueful realization, recounted in his <i>A
New Republic of Letters</i>, that after half a lifetime of work, his best bet
at preserving the University of Virginia’s ground-breaking <a href="http://www.rossettiarchive.org/" title="Rossetti Archive"><span style="color:blue">Rossetti Archive</span></a> in the face of technology’s

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto"><font size="3" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">All of us working in digital
publishing and preservation wrestle with these maddening issues; but the
TAGOKOR saga, beginning as it does at the dawn of digitization, graphically
highlights how mad it is to think of preservation as an act of forever
suspending information in digital amber, never to be altered by storage media,
bureaucratic practice, or relentless technological migration. There is no
reason to think that the digital march will ever end, or even slow down, which
means that the academy has to rigorously examine any illusions it may have that
preservation in the analog sense is a realistic option. “And so the biography
of TAGOKOR,” Bailey writes, “like all archival records, is one both already
written and never completed, both continually becoming and terminally
changeless, forever poised between incident and encoding, articulation and
preservation, record and reinterpretation, finality and vitality.” For someone
in my line of work, this is, by turns, tremendously depressing and tremendously
exhilarating.<br>
