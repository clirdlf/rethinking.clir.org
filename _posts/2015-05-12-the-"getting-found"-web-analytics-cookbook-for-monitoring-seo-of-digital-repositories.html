<p>A new toolkit that helps libraries measure and monitor the search engine optimization (SEO) performance of their digital repositories is one of the products of research funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services<a href="#_ftn1"
    name="_ftnref1" title=""></a>.* <i>The Getting Found (GF) Cookbook</i> includes everythingnecessaryto implement apreconfigured Google Analytics dashboard that continuously monitors SEO performance metrics relevant to digital repositories. The
  <i>GF Cookbook</i> is freely available at<a href="http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub165">http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub165</a>. </p>
<h2 class="editorSelectH2">Description</h2>
<p>Web analytics are useful tools that can help administrators and staff demonstrate the value of library services to external stakeholders as well as make informed decisions about internal resource allocations. <i>The GF Cookbook</i> guides the
  correct implementation of web analytics tools for accurate overview and long-term monitoring of digital repository performance.</p>
<p>Google Analytics (GA) and Google Webmaster Tools (GWT) are powerful and freely available software tools that are most commonly used by libraries in the United States. While the <i>GF Cookbook</i> has been created for use with GA, the principles
  and practices used in the <em>Cookbook</em> can be applied to any page tagging analytics software.</p>
<h3 class="editorSelectH3">Baseline Measurements</h3>
<p><i>The GF Cookbook</i> offers a process and tools designed for a single person who is responsible for establishing and maintaining GA for their library organization. This includes a survey to inventory and coordinate hardware systems, online
  services such as institutional social media accounts, and web properties including digital repositories or collections. It also helps identify stakeholders as well as the roles people play and the skills required to implement and maintain a library
  SEO effort.</p>
<h3 class="editorSelectH3">Dashboard</h3>
<p>Based on Google Analytics, the preconfigured dashboard allows library staff and administrators to monitor common baseline performance metrics relevant to library repositories. The dashboard is hosted in the <a
    href="https://www.google.com/analytics/gallery/"><i>Google Analytics Solutions Gallery</i></a> where it is titled "Getting Found SEO Dashboard." </p>
<p>It empowers administrators to ask pertinent questions when changes are observed. For instance, a sudden drop in the number of items indexed by Google in a given collection could prompt an administrator to question the appropriate manager or staff
  person responsible for that collection.</p>
<h2 class="editorSelectH2">Video Tutorials</h2>
<p>The <em>GF Cookbook</em> provides a series of basic video tutorials to integrate the necessary analytics for consistent evaluation and monitoring of library objectives. The videos describe the steps and information necessary to implement baseline
  SEO metrics relevant to library administrators and collection managers. </p>
<h4><a name="h.37l0puacl9fa"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/126813540">Justifying the Need</a></h4>
<p class="normal">The first video describes the reasons for an institutionalized SEO program and provides graphic data demonstrating the authors' achievements in improving use of digital libraries. </p>
<h4><a name="h.947bq0oacfos"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/126813541">Strategic Planning</a></h4>

<h4><a name="h.tmm3khkbr8ht"></a><a href="https://vimeo.com/126813542">Creating an Institutional Google Account</a></h4>
<p class="normal">Part of the difficulty in establishing a comprehensive and integrated SEO program is that various people in the organization tend to manage different accounts. This video demonstrates the process for establishing a single master
  account to maintain organizational continuity and to administer all Google Web Service accounts owned by the library organization.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The<i> Getting Found Cookbook</i> is designed to help libraries implement web analytics tools so that they may monitor and measure the effectiveness of their SEO programs. In a time when Internet search engines have
  become the default discovery layer for the vast majority of users, it is crucial that libraries are able to report that their websites and digital repositories are discoverable through those search engines as well. Assessment begins with accurate
  baseline measurements and the ability to track performance and react to changes. The <em>GF Cookbook</em> will help empower libraries to tell stories with the support of data.</p>
